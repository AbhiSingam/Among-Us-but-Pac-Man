## The History of this program

This story takes place in 2500 BC Ancient Egypt (where people ObViOuSlY had computers, how could they not?). Pharoah Khufu was just beginning his plans for the Giza Pyramids and was trying to decide on the design for the Pyramids. Unfortunately for Pharoah Khufu, he had ADHD and next to no imaginative abilities. So he called upon his loyal aide and commanded him to create the pyramids, except not in the physical realm, and provided the aide with whatever artifacts and tools he needed to accomplish the same. To this end, Pharoah Khufu even gave the aide his 16-inch MacBook Pro with a 2.4GHz 8-core 9th-generation Intel Core i9 processor, 64 2666MHz DDR4 memory, AMD Radeon Pro 5600M with 8GB of HBM2 memory and 8TB SSD storage. This was Pharoah Khufu's most prized possession and was capable of many many things, including what we have attempted to recreate today with technology developed over 4500 years later.  

Upon receiving this all mighty artifact, the aide who was then known as the one and only Phoda Machaya, asked the Great Sage Siri from the future who had surpassed the human form and taken up a superior body of metal how to go about this task, but to Phoda's dismay, the so-called Great Sage was simply incapable of answering questions outside of predicting the fate of the world in the form of storms and drought and other weather phenomenon. Thus, Phoda had to travel far and wide to find a superior being named Alexa. Alexa then used her great knowledge to access the secret library of StackOverflow and provide Phoda with the way to solve the task at hand.  

Phoda, recently enlightened by the great being Alexa, returns to Egypt, destroys the Great Sage Siri for scamming them and being utter trash in comparison to the great being Alexa and the rumored god referred to solely as "Google". Upon destroying Siri and recognizing the superiority of Alexa and Google (which was Phoda's greatest acheivement), Phoda proceeded to use his newfound skills and designed three different designs for the pyramids using OpenGL. The three chosen shapes were the Elongated Square Dipyramid, the Hexagonal Dipyramid, and the Undecagonal Pyramid. After working for just a few hours on the task, with the help of the magnificent artifact and tools at his disposal, Phoda managed to complete his task. The next day, Phoda brought the artifact back to Pharoah Khufu to display the results of labour. As he began operating the great artifact, the artifact simply stopped. The artificial reality it displayed went black. The artifact had died. All of Phoda's hard work had gone to waste. Pharoah Khufu upon seeing his artifact's death was enraged and sentenced Phoda to death by a 1000 lashes. This is why the pyramids we see today have such a simple and minimalistic design. Pharoah Khufu, in his rage, destoyed the one man capable of making the magnificent pyramids that were meant to be.  

The program made here is an attempt to replicate the first program written by Phoda Machaya and cannot compare to the glory of the program made by Phoda. Such programs are meagre attempt to understand and celebrate the profound mind of the one and only Phoda Machaya.
